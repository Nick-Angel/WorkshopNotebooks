## What is this?

This repository serves the purpose of providing instructional material related to various topics in data science to be discussed in Deep Learning @ UGA workshops. The purpose of these workshops is to provide a soft introduction to data science for complete beginners and supply them with the necessary tools to begin projects on their own.

## How do I view these notebooks?

__If jupyter notebook isn't installed__, click the _launch binder_ badge above to be linked to my personal binder that will allow the user to view the jupyter notebook and interact with it.
